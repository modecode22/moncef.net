Sudden progress moments are the result of a lot of previous work. In other words, progress is not really measured by the progress itself, but by the number of steps you take towards that progress.

A year and a half ago, with the goal of building a successful technology company, I took my first steps in learning HTML. Luckily for me, and knowing this law, I have been learning every day until this moment. I ask God to help me build this company, and find my moment of sudden progress.

#### In this blog, you will follow the story of my many steps to reach my sudden progress.
